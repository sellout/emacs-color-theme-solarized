If you have come across this colorscheme via the [Emacs-only repository] on 
github, see the link above to the Solarized homepage or visit the main [Solarized repository].

The [Emacs-only repository] is kept in sync with the main [Solarized repository]. Issues, bug reports, changelogs that are not specific to the Emacs implementation should be submitted to the main [Solarized repository].

Installation & Usage
--------------------

### Emacs 24

1. Add the `emacs-color-theme-solarized` directory to your Emacs `load-path`.
2. `M-x enable-theme`, then either `solarized-light` or `solarized-dark`.

### [color-theme] \(pre-Emacs 24\)

1. Download and install [color-theme].
2. Add the `emacs-color-theme-solarized` directory to your Emacs `load-path`.
3. Add `(require 'color-theme-solarized)` to your Emacs init file (usually `~/.emacs`).
4. Use the usual [color-theme] mechanism to select one of the Solarized themes, or `M-x color-theme-solarized-[light|dark]`.

### IMPORTANT NOTE FOR TERMINAL USERS:

If you are going to use Solarized in Terminal mode (i.e. not in a GUI version
like Cocoa or X11 Emacs), **please please please** consider setting your
terminal emulator's colorscheme to use the Solarized palette. The [Solarized
repository] includes palettes for some popular terminal emulator as well as
Xdefaults; or you can download them from the official [Solarized homepage].
If you use this emacs color theme *without* having changed your emulator's
palette, you will need to configure Solarized to degrade its colorscheme to
a set compatible with the terminal's default limited 256 color palette
(whereas by using the terminal's 16 ANSI color values, you would
see the correct, specific values for the Solarized palette).

If you do use the custom terminal colors, i.e. the 16 overridden ANSI color
values, the emacs colorscheme should work out of the box for you. If you are
using a terminal emulator that supports 256 colors and don't want to use
the custom Solarized terminal colors, you will need to use the degraded 256
colorscheme. To do so, simply customize the `solarized-termcolor` variable to
`256`.

Again, I recommend just changing your terminal colors to Solarized values 
either manually or via one of the many terminal schemes available for import.

Advanced Configuration
----------------------

Solarized will work out of the box with just the instructions specified above
but does include several variables that can be customized.

    variable name           default   optional
    -------------------------------------------
    solarized-termcolors=   16    |   256
    solarized-degrade   =   nil   |   t
    solarized-bold      =   t     |   nil
    solarized-underline =   t     |   nil
    solarized-italic    =   t     |   nil
    solarized-contrast  =   normal|   high, low
    solarized-visibility=   normal|   high, low
    -------------------------------------------

### Option Details

*   solarized-termcolors

    This is set to *16* by default, meaning that Solarized will attempt to use 
    the standard 16 colors of your terminal emulator, assuming that you've set
    these colors to the correct Solarized values either manually or by 
    importing one of the many colorscheme available for popular terminal 
    emulators and Xdefaults.
    If you don't want to use the Solarized colors via the terminal
    emulator's palette, you can set this to *256*, which will use a degraded
    version of the Solarized palette by displaying the closest colors in
    the terminal's default 256 colors as shown in [Xterm's color
    chart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Xterm_color_chart.png).

*   solarized-degrade

    For test purposes only; in GUI mode, this forces Solarized to use the 256
    degraded color mode to test the approximate color values for accuracy.

*   solarized-bold | solarized-underline | solarized-italic

    If you wish to stop Solarized from displaying bold, underlined or 
    italicized typefaces, simply set the appropriate variable to `nil`.

*   solarized-contrast

    Stick with normal! It's been carefully tested. Setting this option to high 
    or low does use the same Solarized palette but simply shifts some values
    up or down in order to expand or compress the tonal range displayed.

*   solarized-visibility

    Special characters such as trailing whitespace, tabs, newlines, when
    displayed using `:set list` can be set to one of three levels depending on 
    your needs. Default value is `normal` with `high` and `low` options.

Code Notes
----------

I have attempted to modularize the creation of Emacs colorschemes in this script and, while it could be refactored further, it should be a good foundation for the creation of any color scheme. By simply changing the  values in the `solarized-colors` table in `solarized-definitions.el` and testing in a GUI Emacs, you can rapidly prototype new colorschemes without diving into the weeds of line-item editing each syntax highlight declaration.

The Values
----------

L\*a\*b values are canonical (White D65, Reference D50), other values are 
matched in sRGB space.
